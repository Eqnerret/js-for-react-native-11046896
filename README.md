### Overview

This repository contains solutions for a set of activities that rely on JavaScript functions for array manipulation and user profile construction. Each task's succinct description and implementation are provided below.

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

- **Description:**  The function "processArray" accepts an array of numbers as input and generates a new array based on certain rules. In the resulting array, every even number is squared, and every odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings

- **Description:** The "formatArrayStrings" function is designed to operate on two arrays: one containing strings and the other containing numbers processed by a function called "processArray." For each string in the string array, the function adjusts the string based on its corresponding number: capitalizing the entire string if the number is even, and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.


### Task 3: Creating User Profiles

- **Description:** The function "createUserProfiles" accepts two arrays: one containing original names and another containing modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, where each object includes the original name, the modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
